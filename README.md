# Hot N' Fast Website

## <u>Overview</u>

This is a full-stack website I created for an imaginary fast-food restaurant named **"Hot N' Fast"**. The reason I  am creating this website is to get amy hands dirty and get a feel of the full-stack development process. **<u>NOTE:</u>** I used the same products as **McDonalds** to populate my menu. There are going to be 3 pages for menu: **Breakfast, Sandwiches & Wraps and Snacks & Sides**

## <u>Tech Stack used for this website<u>

This is the tech stack I used for this project. It was inspired by Theo's T3 stack, namely: 

- Next.JS
- TailwindCSS
- Typescript
- Prisma
- Next-Auth
- Zustand State Management
- React Query

Additionally, I used PaaS service providers such as PostgreSQL.


<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
